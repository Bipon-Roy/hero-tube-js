                                clarification and help when debugging errors related to these two

                                value. A variable will only return null if a programmer or an API
                                specifically assigns the value null to the variable.

                        What do you mean by REST API?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define
                        how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other.
                        A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or
                        representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST
                        APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database
                        functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known
                        as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request
                        to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update
                        a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used
                        in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a
                        web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that
                        defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API
                        is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without
                        having any processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Working:</strong> A request is sent from client to server in the
                        form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that,
                        a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be
                        anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular
                        format being used in Web Services.
